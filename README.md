# Modified-DCF_Python
The Modified Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method is an proposed theory that relates the polarization of light to the large scale magnetic field strength of the interstellar medium.

This method is based off the paper written by Houde et al. (2009)- https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.5227.pdf.


# Dependencies
Make sure to install the follow packages using pip in Python.
```python
import numpy 
import matplotlib.pyplot 
import scipy 
import astropy
import regions
```

# MDCFpy 
Currently there is only a Python3 implementation of the method (future C version will be imminent).

For those who use juptyer notebook, you can follow the instructions given in <ins>MDCF_Analysis_Example.ipynb</ins> for clear instructions on how to use the script.

For those that prefer to run from terminal, please check out the tutorial section for further instructions.
