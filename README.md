# Modified-DCF_Python
The Modified Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method written in Python.

This method is based off the paper written by Houde et al. (2009)- https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.5227.pdf and is used to calculate the magnetic field strength of given polarization map. 

<h3> MDCFpy </h3>

Currently there is only a Python3 implementation of the method (future C version will be imminent).

One can follow the instructions given in MDCF_Analysis_Example.ipynb for clear instructions on how to use the script.

For those that prefer to run from terminal, please check out the main.py file.
